## OS Support

Tested only with
[mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/artifact/mar/devcontainers/base/about#about:_ubuntu).

## Docs Directory

If the directory configured in the `docs-path` option does not exist, it is
automatically created when the devcontainer starts.

If the directory configured in the `docs-path` does not contain any
`index.html`, both a starter `index.html` as well as `README.md` will be
created.
